# Overview
A Bézier curve is defined by a set of control points <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\textbf{P_0}"> to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\textbf{P_n}">, where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> is the order of the Bézier curve (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n = 1"> for linear
curves, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n = 2"> for quadratic curves, etc.). The first and last control points are always at the end of the curves, but intermediate control points are not constrained to the curve.
